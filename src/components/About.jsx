      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the ultimate Six Flags adventure guide!</p>
      <p>Here, you'll find a curated list of some of our favorite rides, complete with descriptions, height requirements, and thrill levels. Can't find your favorite ride? We've made it easy for you to contribute by adding it to our growing listâ€”just go to the Ride Form in the navigation!</p>
      <p>This project is the result of a one-day Full Stack-A-Thon, where our team dove into the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node.js) to bring this site to life.</p>
      <p>Please keep your arms and legs within your chair at all times, and enjoy your ride through our site!</p>
